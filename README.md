## **About me**😄

Who graduated from the engineering department and pursued with MBA in the International business management field. I used to work as an import and export manager for international companies. Since the Covid-19 restriction, I kicked my career in the tech field. I’ve been on a self-learning-to-code journey for a year and looking forward to speeding up this process within a supportive and friendly environment with an intensive bootcamp. I have improved my basic coding skill for HTML and CSS, while still trying to get further knowledge of blockchain and web3 applications of my interests. Therefore, I made a switch and start the software development bootcamp with Makers.

## **Skills**👏
- **Quick Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project in React and Realm with no prior experience.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are a problem, only opportunities. I have worked on shoots around the world with huge diversity of crews and technologies. There is always a way to connect.
- **Creative** - As a engineer, trained in fine art, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.
- **Attention to detail** - I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks.
- **Team-player** - Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a hybrid student. This required discipline and focus – with a considerable helping of self-belief.

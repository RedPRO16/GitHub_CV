## Nesho RADEV
Who graduated from the engineering department and pursued with MBA in the International business management field. I used to work as an import and export manager for international companies. Since covid restriction, I decided to kick my career in the tech field.
I’ve been on a self-learning coding journey for a year and looking forward to accelerating this process within a supportive and friendly environment with you!
I have improved my coding skill for HTML, CSS and basic PYTHON while still trying to get further knowledge of blockchain and web3 applications of my interests. I decided to make a switch and start the software development bootcamp with Makers.

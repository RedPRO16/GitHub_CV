## **About me**😄

I graduated from the engineering department and pursued with MBA in the International business management field. I used to work as an import and export manager for international companies. Since the Covid-19 restriction, I kicked off my career in the tech field from a mechanical engineer to a full stack software developer! 
I have a passion for writing clean, test-driven code and am excited to start this new chapter of my professional career, whilst utilising the skills and approaches I’ve developed from both my engineering background, such as creative solutions to problem-solving, time management and attention to detail. Therefore, I made a switch and start an intensive software development bootcamp with Makers.
Through Makers Academy, I have learned how vital planning and teamwork are to building an amazing product, and the fundamentals of a solid TDD practice.  I thrived in the CI/CD process, especially when working with Heroku. Where much of my cohort struggled with Heroku, I excelled and used this as an opportunity to help guide them through their stack trace. This not only gave me so much happiness to be collaborative, but it also allowed me to repay them for their guidance in my past struggles.

My goal is to explore as much as about full-stack and then transfer into a specialised blockchain and Web3 applications developer role.

## **Skills**👏
- **Quick Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project in React and Realm with no prior experience.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are a problem, only opportunities. I have worked on shoots around the world with huge diversity of crews and technologies. There is always a way to connect.
- **Creative** - As a engineer, trained in fine art, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.
- **Attention to detail** - I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks.
- **Team-player** - Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a hybrid student. This required discipline and focus – with a considerable helping of self-belief.
